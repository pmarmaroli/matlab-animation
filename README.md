## sound source localization - two microphone arrays
**video:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUbjNSG2UK4

This animation beautifully demonstrates the fundamental physics of sound waves and their detection, highlighting how differences in wave arrival times can be used for localization.

**Key Physics Concepts**

- Wave Propagation: the animation shows how sound waves travel through the air at a constant speed (343 m/s).
- Hyperbolic Localization: the green line represents a hyperbola, indicating all possible positions of the sound source based on the time difference of arrival (TDOA) at the two microphones.
- Triangulation: while two microphones can narrow down the source to a hyperbolic line, a third microphone would be needed to precisely locate the exact position.
